# HCJ Starter
A productivity starter kit for full-stack AngularJS (v1) developers.

# Why bother

- It codifies a bunch of decisions that you'll have to make each time you start a project. 
- **Stop working like an amateur** and use/create a starter kit. They contain:
  - Good practices
  - Lessons learnt
  - Encourages consistency/predictability
  - Avoid forgetting important details
- Too much BS involved to setup a productive environment as a JS developer. Save yourself hours of headache and use this template.
